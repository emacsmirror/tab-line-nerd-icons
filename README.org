* tab-line-nerd-icons.el - Add icons to tab-line

This package uses the [[https://github.com/rainstormstudio/nerd-icons.el][nerd-icons]] package to apply appropriate icons to tab-line tabs.

** Installation

For now this package isn't on any package archive. If you have Emacs 29.1 or later you can use package-vc-install to get the package.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (when (package-installed-p 'tab-line-nerd-icons)
    (package-vc-install ('tab-line-nerd-icons :url "")))
#+end_src

I will add the package to MELPA later.

Enable with:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (tab-line-nerd-icons-global-mode)
#+end_src
